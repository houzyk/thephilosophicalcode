Have you ever considered the complexity of problem-solving and the quest for knowledge in our increasingly evolving world?  Computational thinking is a relatively new field that's based on the principles of computer science, but it has become a potent framework that may revolutionize the way we make sense of the complexities of our existence.  How do we create algorithms to solve a problem?  Then, how do we know that the solution is really effective?  Even if we are certain that the solution will work, how can we instruct a computer to execute it?

Fun fact - if you had a hard time contemplating any of these questions, *you might actually be doing philosophy.*

While computational thinking might not decode why it takes longer to find matching socks than to solve complex equations, we are going to combine the principles of computer science with the insights of philosophy and take a look at some intriguing parallels between them to explore the philosophy of computational thinking, progressively revealing the deeper meanings of its applications.

## The Mind of the Machine
Let's first understand the fundamentals of computational thinking.  Imagine coming upon a challenging issue that initially appears to be overwhelming.  Computational thinking encompasses a series of skills and thought processes that urge us to walk through the labyrinth of challenges, identify patterns and relationships and use algorithms to solve problems by a filtering process.  These are skills which are also essential for philosophical inquiries, like finding meaning in the complexities surrounding us.

*I'll show you how.*

The study of basic issues in reality, knowledge, morality, and existence is known as philosophy.  The theory deals with complex and abstract concepts such as human behaviour, history, and nature.  It is a style of looking at the world that pushes us to question our presumptions and preconceptions.  In order to break down large issues into smaller, more manageable pieces, computational thinking can be a useful technique for philosophical research.  We lay the groundwork for creating meaning by deconstructing the issue and comprehending its core elements.

## Existentialism: It's Not Just a Phase, Mom
At the core of the philosophical school of existentialism is the idea that human beings are responsible for creating meaning in their own lives.  As humans, we attempt to explore fundamental questions related to freedom, purpose, and existence - the complexities surrounding us.  Existentialists believe that human beings are confronted with the inherent uncertainty and ambiguity of existence and that we must confront this existential reality with authenticity. There is a sense of responsibility for our own choices and we are all free to create our own meaning of life.

Despite the fact that existentialism is a complicated and multifaceted philosophy, using computational thinking in parallel with it might be a complementary approach to develop a more comprehensive and effective methodology to understand and solve its complexities.  Both fields emphasize an introspection between structure and freedom, determinism and choice, and they both foster in-depth reflection.

## Breaking down complexity
Complexity looms in the vast fabric of existence.  We are constantly bombarded with data and it can be difficult to make sense of it all.  However, computational thinking allows us to break down complex notions and ideas by using the four steps below:

**1. Decomposition**

Break down the problem into smaller, more manageable pieces, to decipher the essence of their interconnectedness.  For example, if you are trying to write a program to calculate the area of a circle, you could break the problem down into the following steps:

&ensp;a)	Declare the variables.

&ensp;b)	Get the radius of the circle.

&ensp;c)	Calculate the area of the circle.

In other words, you write the pseudocode.

Let's say you're trying to understand the concept of existentialism in philosophy, you could break it down as follows:

&ensp;a)	Personal autonomy: The idea that individuals have the free will to choose and create meaning

&ensp;b)	Authenticity: The idea that individuals should live in accordance with their own values and beliefs

&ensp;c)	Accountability: The idea that we are all responsible for our actions

&ensp;d)	The quest for meaning: The idea that we are constantly searching for meaning


**2. Pattern recognition:**

Pattern recognition is a key component of computational thinking.  It is employed to identify patterns and relationships between the pieces we broke down earlier, which can be used to make predictions, identify opportunities and draw parallels between distinct scenarios.  For instance, pattern recognition can be used to identify trends in stock prices.  This information can then be used to make predictions about the future performance of the stock market.

Philosophy employs pattern recognition to gain philosophical insights and expand knowledge in the abstract world.  The technique can be used to identify patterns in human behaviour, history and nature.

By leveraging pattern recognition, computational thinking and philosophy can mutually enhance each other's methodologies and contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the complexities surrounding us.

**3. Abstraction**

In Computer Science, abstraction is used to capture crucial characteristics shared by a group of items while obscuring unimportant differences between them.  Abstraction gives us the ability to manage complexity.

An algorithm, for instance, is an abstraction of a procedure that accepts inputs, performs a series of stages, and generates outputs to achieve a certain objective.  An abstract data type specifies an abstract collection of values and methods for working with those values, concealing the real values' representation from the user.  Designing abstract data types is fundamentally a part of creating efficient algorithms.  Abstraction can also be used to create classes in object-oriented programming.  Classes are templates for creating objects, and they allow us to focus on the important details of the objects without having to worry about irrelevant details.

In philosophy, abstraction can be used to create categories.  Categories are groups of concepts that share common features.  By creating categories, you can organize your knowledge and make it easier to understand your complexities.  To grasp the essence of existentialism, it is essential to focus on the most important information and ignore the irrelevant details.  This means peeling off particular philosophical defences or historical context to identify the core concepts, such as the priority of human existence, the subjectivity of meaning, and the significance of individual responsibility and choice.  As such, we can obtain a deeper understanding when trying to find meaning in complexity.

**4. Algorithmic thinking**

Develop a step-by-step solution to the problem. René Descartes believed that methodical reasoning was the best way to solve problems.  He argued that we should start with a clear and distinct idea of what we are trying to achieve, and then break the problem down into smaller, more manageable steps.  We should, then, work through each step in a logical order and only move on to the next step when the said conditions are met.  The philosopher's syllogism, where truth unfolds through a chain of interconnected propositions, is a method of problem-solving known as algorithmic thinking.

For example, Descartes' methodical reasoning could be used to solve a math problem.  Let's say we want to solve the equation 2x + 3 = 7.  We could start by breaking the equation down into smaller steps.  First, we could subtract 3 from both sides of the equation, which would give us 2x = 4.  Then, we could divide both sides of the equation by 2, which would give us x = 2.  Algorithmic thinking could be used to solve a computer programming problem. Let's say we want to write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 10.  We could start by breaking the problem down into smaller steps.  First, we could create a variable to store the number 1.  Then, we could create a loop that iterates 10 times.  Inside the loop, we could print the value of the variable and then increment the value of the variable by 1.

Essentially, if you break down any complexity, finding a solution should be pretty straightforward, *right*?

Ha!  *No.*  Complexity has its own way of defying our expectations and resisting easy resolutions.

## The Machine of the Mind

The aim is to improve philosophical study, discovery and arguments by simply using computational models and tools.  Therefore, neither a strong separation between computational and non-computational philosophy nor between computational philosophy and other computational fields should be anticipated.  Meaning-making while navigating through the complexities of our existence is a profound personal endeavour.  It involves actively engaging with information, drawing connections and synthesizing knowledge.  In many ways, it is similar to crafting a beautiful jumper where each stitch represents an idea and every thread is enlaced to form a coherent pattern.

Existentialists have emphasized finding meaning in life through action, relationships, and creativity.

**1. Through action**

When we act, we make choices and take responsibility for our actions.  This gives us a sense of purpose and direction.

**2. Through relationships**

When we connect with others, we feel a sense of belonging and acceptance.  This can help us to feel grounded and supported.

**3. Through creativity**

When we express ourselves creatively, we are tapping into our unique potential.  This can help us to feel fulfilled and alive.

### A dash of Existential Dread

![Existentialism Game.](/images/one-byte-at-a-time/Existentialism_Game.gif)

When we ask ourselves questions about the meaning of life, we can start to explore what gives our lives meaning.  Some (quite dense) questions I usually ask myself when trying to find meaning include:

_•	What is the meaning of life?_

Such a question indubitably entails a panoply of answers and yet, it is a question always worth asking.  Is it to live a life of virtue?  Is it to seek pleasure, maximise our own happiness, and avoid pain?  Is the meaning of life ultimately meaningless?  Or is the meaning of life up to each individual to decide?  Franz Kafka's perspective adds an existential flavour to the discourse on life's meaning, stating that "the meaning of life is that it ends", highlighting the transient nature of human existence.  Kafka also suggests that "the only way to find meaning in life is to create it".

_•	What is my purpose in life?_

Moving beyond the overarching question of life's meaning, this question takes a more personal and introspective approach, seeking to understand an individual's unique contribution to the world. It is a dynamic process.  Is it to achieve happiness and knowledge of the good?  Or is it to overcome nihilism?  For Kierkegaard, existing meant becoming more and more individual, yet this opportunity is not uniformly available to all individuals, as many may find themselves living in an "inauthentic" manner.  Ultimately, the purpose of life is to live it.

Okay, I know these questions may seem superficial or shallow, like pseudo-problems (which are, by the way, part of the essence of philosophy), but they have the power to induce existential crises in me, and that's..*amazing*!

## Could we do better?

Computational thinking is a way of thinking and a way of being in the world.  Coupled with programmed instructions, computational thinking is ultimately just an instrument that will take you to the end of the complexity.  However, it does not guarantee a completely *"bug-free"* solution.  The mastery of computational thinking blossoms over time, much like a philosopher's intellectual journey, actually.  I believe that computational thinkers are philosophers in action.  By engaging with the mind of machines, the child becomes a philosopher in action, inquisitive and mentally agile, embarking on a transformative quest for knowledge.

Meaning is a jumper that you have to knit yourself.  Meaning is not something that is given to us, but something that we have to create for ourselves.  Meaning is not easy to find, nor is it fixed.  It is something that we actively build through our engagement with information and ideas.  It changes as we learn and grow.  There is no right way to do it. However, by embracing the fusion of philosophy and computational thinking, we can open up new possibilities to find some sort of meaning in our lives.  We can use computational thinking to explore the world around us, to better understand ourselves and to create new things.  One byte at a time, finding meaning urges us to embrace the fusion of these two disciplines and all of a sudden, everything will make sense.
