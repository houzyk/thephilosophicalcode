# Adding A Resource In The Reading List (Stuff)

## Housekeeping

1. Add your resource in `./content/stuff.md`
2. If you have any links as a resource, please write them in the following format.

```
[LinkTitle](YOUR-URL LinkTitle)
```

3. Please update the date of the stuff page to when you send your PR.
4. Add your resource(s) under a heading or create a new one if needed.

## Rules

1. Make sure that you're not adding a duplicate.
2. Please refrain from using foul words, spam resources or unsafe links.
3. Your resource should concern at least the intersection of Philosophy, CS, Mathematics, Linguistics or Logic. Or any of the topics mentioned [here](https://thephilosophicalcode.com/).

## Credit

I highly appreciate any new resource. So, I will be adding your name under the "Contributors" section to the [people's section](https://thephilosophicalcode.com/people/) to show appreciation.
