# The Philosophical Code

Exploring Code From A Philosophical Point Of View.

The Philosophical Code is an open-source article series exploring the intersection of philosophy and computation. Our raison d'Ãªtre is quite simple - think of code like a Ferrari! It's a very powerful car and we can go to a lot of places with it. The job of the Engineer is to drive that car; the job of the "Philosopher Of Code" is to open its hood and study the engines. In other words, our goal is to conceptually break down computation itself.
